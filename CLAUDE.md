# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new/empty project directory named "るーぷつくーる" (Loop Tool). No source code or project files have been identified yet.

## Development Commands

No specific build, test, or development commands have been identified since no project files exist yet.

## Code Architecture

No code architecture has been established yet as this directory currently only contains configuration files.

## Important Notes

- This is currently an empty project directory
- No package managers, build tools, or frameworks have been identified
- Future instances should analyze the actual codebase once project files are added
- The directory name suggests this may be a tool or application related to loops ("ループツール" in Japanese)

## Next Steps

When project files are added:
1. Identify the technology stack and framework being used
2. Update this file with relevant build/test commands
3. Document the project architecture and file structure
4. Add any project-specific coding conventions or patterns
